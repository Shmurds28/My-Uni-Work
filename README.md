# Personalised Workload Schedule - MyUniWork

The aim of this research project is to build a tool that provides prospective honours students at the point of registration with what the workload impact will be for a particular selection of modules. Once a module selection has been made, the tool provides a customised workload schedule for the studentâ€™s academic year. Additionally, the tool allows lecturers to administer all the module and lecturer information needed for the functionalities of the tool and further administer all the module assessments.
